# Requirements.txt_generator
You have written your Python script and want to upload it to GitHub.
But you need to include a "Requirements.txt" file so the other users know which packages have been used in your script.

I'm here to make your life easier. Simply copy this script into the folder containing the python script(s) for which the requirements are needed to be extracted and execute it. A "Requirements.txt" file will be generated with the package name and associated version number.s
